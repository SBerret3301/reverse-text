Explanation:

1. `p + p`: This CSS selector targets the second `p` element that directly follows another `p` element. The styles are then applied to this second paragraph.

   - `direction: rtl;`: Sets the text direction to right-to-left. This is often used for languages that are written from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew.

   - `unicode-bidi: bidi-override;`: Overrides the bidirectional algorithm, ensuring that the specified right-to-left direction is applied.

The HTML document contains two paragraphs. The first paragraph has a regular left-to-right text direction, while the second paragraph, selected using the CSS selector, has a right-to-left text direction. This can be useful for handling bidirectional text in specific situations. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
